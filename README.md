This piece of code is based on "https://github.com/PradipNichite/Youtube-Tutorials/blob/main/Spacy_Custom_NER_Youtube.ipynb" his code except that in my piece of code the same config file can be rewritten as well which was not the case with Pradip's codebase, there one had to create new config files each time new data was appended
